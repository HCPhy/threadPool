this for personal education on
1. what is a ms lock free queue
2. how to the queue is put in a producer-consumer model
3. how to handle the enqueue/dequeue in a safe manner. (hazard domain)


other education perpose:
1. how templates work (again)
2. how smart pointers work (the tasks submitted to the queue need to be put in heap, and thus it is best to use shared_ptr to handle such function ptr)
3. how mutex work, in both scoped lock and conditional variables.
